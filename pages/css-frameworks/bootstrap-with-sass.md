## Introduction

The video in this lesson is an introduction to using Sass to customize Bootstrap itself and then apply custom styles on top of those provided by Bootstrap.

Apart from the other advantages of using Sass, the multiple server requests to fetch all imported CSS files that we encountered in lesson 1 are condensed into one request.

We will see how to provide new values for Bootstrap’s variables by downloading and compiling the source files rather than linking them to the CDN version of the library.
